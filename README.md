# Agentic-AI
A collection of AI-powered agents built using LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit. This repository serves as a hub for experimenting with different types of intelligent agents for tasks like sales qualification, customer support, data querying, and automation workflows. Each agent is modular, extendable, and designed for real-world applications.
